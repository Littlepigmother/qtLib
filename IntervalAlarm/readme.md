## background
Computer has been in our lives, many people use it for works, but if we spent a long time with computers, health would be in danger. We can change the embarrassed situation just did a few of adjustments.

So I write a music alarm for it. 

## what makes it
The application is made by qt creator.   

## how to use it
Users can define interval time for playing for it. For example, I set the interval time 30 minutes, the program would play a song in the inner list every half an hour. When you heard the music, you know that it's time to make a tea or just go to relax room.

The application has one minute after initialization, it is designed to test your computer whether it can play music successfully. 
<li> If your computer's os is windows and it can't play music by the application, please install decoder LAV Filters. You can find installation application from https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases. 
<li> If you are mac users, you need nothing else to install.

If data.txt file is removed unintentionally, just new one file with the same name. 

We can add some music songs to the application list or remove some ones from list.

In the song played period, you can stand up and move around with music playing, you can turn down the volume and have a silence or you can choose to click "stop playing music" button and keep working.

good luck.
